    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Grilled, marinated portobello steaks with a spicy avocado chimichurri sauce! An incredibly hearty and flavorful 30-minute plant-based meal!</p>
    <p>This is the perfect option for all your summer grilling needs. They’re great on their own but would also pair well with salads, mashed potatoes, or cooked quinoa, millet, or rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><strong>Mushrooms</strong></p>
        <ul class="ingredients-list">
            <li>3 large portobello mushrooms (stems removed, wiped clean)</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp smoked paprika</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp steak sauce (optional)</li>
         </ul>

        <p><strong>Chimichurri</strong></p>
        <ul class="ingredients-list">
            <li>1 ½ cups finely chopped parsley (either kind will work, but flat leaf Italian parsley is best)</li>
            <li>2-3 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
            <li>1 medium shallot (minced // 1 shallot yields ~1/4 cup chopped)</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp red pepper flake</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp olive oil (extra virgin when possible)</li>
            <li>2 Tbsp lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp each sea salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>1 small ripe avocado (cubed)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol class="steps-list">
            <li>Add portobello mushrooms to a shallow baking dish or large freezer bag. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a small mixing bowl, whisk together balsamic vinegar, olive oil, cumin, black pepper, paprika, garlic, and steak sauce (optional). Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.</li>
            <li>Add sauce to the mushrooms and use a pastry brush to brush on all sides. Marinate on one side for 5 minutes, then the other side for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, prepare chimichurri by adding parsley, garlic, shallot, red pepper flake, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to a medium mixing bowl and whisking to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more lemon juice for acidity, salt for flavor, or red pepper flake for heat. Add avocado and toss to combine. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a grill or a large skillet over medium heat. Cook on each side for 2-3 minutes, or until caramelized and deep golden brown. Brush on any remaining marinade while cooking to infuse more flavor.</li>
            <li>To serve, top portobello steaks with avocado chimichurri. This makes a great standalone meal, but would also pair well with my Pecan Apple Salad, Pear Walnut Salad, or Vegan Mashed Potatoes! They would also pair well with grilled asparagus and/or cooked quinoa, millet, or brown rice. Best when fresh.</li>

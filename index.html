                <li class="recipe-desc-top"><a href="tofu-scramble.html">Southwest Tofu Scramble</a></li>
                <p class="recipe-desc">Savory, Southwest-inspired tofu scramble with lots of veggies and a simple 5-ingredient sauce. Just 10 ingredients, 30 minutes, and 1 pan required!</p>

                <li><a href="chickpea-sandwich.html">Chickpea Sunflower Sandwich</a></li>
                <p class="recipe-desc">30-minute Chickpea Sunflower Sandwich with smashed chickpeas and roasted sunflower seeds in a simple dressing. Sandwiched between two slices of bread and topped with my secret garlic sauce, this is healthy lunch perfection.</p>

                <li><a href="portobello-steaks.html">Portobello Steaks with Avocado Chimichurri</a></li>
                <p class="recipe-desc">Grilled, marinated portobello steaks with a spicy avocado chimichurri sauce! An incredibly hearty and flavorful 30-minute plant-based meal!</p>

                <li><a href="flourless-brownies.html">Flourless Brownies</a></li>
                <p class="recipe-desc-bottom">This two-serving brownie is fudgy and dense with a firm edge, and thanks to the almond butter base, there isnâ€™t a stitch of flour! The nuttiness of the almonds and chopped dark chocolate enhance its rich chocolate flavour. This is a fantastic dessert when you want a decadent treat without being taunted by a pan of leftover brownies in the kitchen. </p>
